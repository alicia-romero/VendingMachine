# VendingMachine

This is a Console Application simulating a Vending Machine and following the MVC design pattern.
You can submit some money, purchase an item from the storage, and recive the change.
Data is stored in a text file, which the program updates automatically.
I use JUnit to test the DAOs and Service Layer.
